## Introduction {data-progressive="FALSE"}

One of the central principles of R is the use of objects.

***In this tutorial, we will learn about the different components of an R object, and how we can create and use them.***

### Notation

Through out this tutorial, we use certain notations for different components in R. To begin, when something is in a gray block, `_`, this indicates that R code is being used. When I am talking about an R Object, it will be displayed as a word. For example, we will be using the R object `mtcars`. When I am talking about an R function, it will be displayed as a word followed by an open and close parentheses. For example, we will use the mean function denoted as `mean()` (read this as "mean function"). When I am talking about an R argument for a function, it will be displayed as a word following by an equal sign. For example, we will use the data argument denoted as `data=` (read this as "data argument"). When I am referencing an R package, I will use `::` (two colons) after the name. For example, in this tutorial, I will use the `ggplot2::` (read this as "ggplot2 package") Lastly, if I am displaying R code for your reference or to run, it will be displayed on its own line. 

### Resources

More information on the topics can be found here: [Data Types](https://www.inqs.info/stat_comp/basics.html#types-of-data), [Objects](https://www.inqs.info/stat_comp/basics.html#sec-r-objects), [Indexing](https://www.inqs.info/stat_comp/control_flow.html#indexing), and [Importing](https://www.inqs.info/stat_comp/importing.html).

## Types of Data

Before we begin learning about R Objects, it is important to learn about different data types. Data types are For this tutorial, there are three types of data: numeric, character, and logical.

### Numeric

Numeric data are data points that represent a number. This can be an integer or a number with decimal values (also known as double). To see if a data value is a number, we can use `is.numeric()`. Try `is.numeric(pi)`:

```{r numeric-pi, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r numeric-pi-solution}
is.numeric(pi)
```

### 

::: info
#### Note

Numeric is one of the most common data types you can work with; however, numbers can be represented as well as a double or integer.
:::

### Character

Character data types are expressions (also known as a string) that do not have a numerical value. These are usually denoted with quotes. For example `"1"` is now considered a character because it focuses on the symbol of one and not the value of one. To check if you have character data, use `is.character()`. Try `is.character("1")`:

```{r char-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r char-1-solution}
is.character("1")
```

### 

::: info
#### Note

Character data can be used different analysis, such as text mining. However, there is a special type of character data type called factor. Factors are data types where only a set number of options are available and they can be leveled in a way.
:::

### Logical

Logical data types are data that only take two values that represent either true or false. True can be represented as either `TRUE`, `T`, or `1`. and false can be represented as either `FALSE`, `F`, or `0`. To check if you have logical data, use `is.logical()`. Try `is.logical(TRUE)`:

```{r log-T, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r log-T-solution}
is.logical(TRUE)
```

### 

::: info
#### Note

Since a logical data type can be represented as `1` and `0`, numerical operations can be applied to the data such as `sum()`, `mean()`, and `var()`.
:::

### Other Data Types

Numerical, Character, and Logical are not the only other data types available in R. R can create data of the following data types:

-   POSIX: time-based data

-   complex: complex numbers

-   factors: levels data

Use the sandbox below to play with other data types:

```{r other_data, exercise = TRUE}

```

## R Objects

Data and results are stored in R objects. R objects can be thought of containers with information. For this class, we will focus on three different types of containers: vectors, lists, and data frames.

### Vectors

Vector can be thought as a set of data points. Each data point is known as an element in the vector. The length of a vector is the number of elements contained. Additionally, all element have the same data type.

The best way to create a vector is by using the `c()`. This combines values together to create a vector. Create a vector called `my_vec` and put the numbers one to ten:

```{r my_vec-setup}
my_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
```

```{r my_vec, exercise = TRUE, }

```

```{r my_vec-solution}
# c approach -----
my_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

# colon -----
my_vec <- 1:10
```

```{r my_vec-check}
grade_this_code()
```

::: {#my_vec-hint}
Try typing each number inside the `c()` and separate them by commas.
:::

To view what is inside the vector, type the name of vector (`my_vec`):

```{r vec, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "my_vec-setup"}

```

```{r vec-solution}
my_vec
```

```{r vec-check}
grade_this_code()
```

To find the length of the vector, use the `length()` function:

```{r len_vec, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "my_vec-setup"}

```

```{r len_vec-solution}
length(my_vec)
```

```{r len_vec-check}
grade_this_code()
```

::: {#len_vec-hint}
Type the name of the object inside the `lenght()`.
:::

### Matrices

A matrix can be thought as a square or rectangular grid of data values. This grid can be constructed in any rectangular shape. Similar to vectors they must contain the same data type. The size of a matrix is usually denoted as $n\times k$, where $n$ represents the number of rows and $k$ represents the number of columns. To get a rough idea of how a matrix may look like, type `matrix(rep(1, 12), nrow = 4, ncol = 3)`. The function `rep()` creates a vector by repeating a value for a certain length, `rep(1, 12)`, creates a vector of length 12 with each element being 1:

```{r mat_one, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r mat_one-solution}

# Option 1 -----
matrix(rep(1, 12), nrow = 4, ncol = 3)

# Option 2 -----
matrix(rep(1, 12), ncol = 3, nrow = 4)


```

```{r mat_one-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Notice that this is a $4\times 3$ matrix. Each element in the matrix has the value 1. Each element in a matrix can hold any value.

Constructing a matrix can be a bit difficult to do because the data values may need to be arranged in a certain way. Notice that I used the `matrix()` function to create the matrix. The examples above contain other components in the function that we will discuss later.

### Arrays

Matrices can be considered as a 2-dimensional block of numbers. An array is an n-dimensional block of numbers. While you may never need to use an array for data analysis. It may come in handy when programming by hand. To create an array, use the `array()` function. Below is an example of a $3 \times 3 \times 3$ with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are in each square matrix of the array. The array will be stored in an R object called `first_array`:

``` default
first_array <- array(c(rep(1, 9), rep(2, 9), rep(3, 9)), dim=c(3, 3, 3))
```

```{r array_1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r array_1-solution}
first_array <- array(c(rep(1, 9), rep(2, 9), rep(3, 9)), 
                     dim=c(3, 3, 3))
```

```{r array_1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

To view the array, type the name of the array

```{r array_1-setup}
first_array <- array(c(rep(1, 9), rep(2, 9), rep(3, 9)), 
                     dim=c(3, 3, 3))
```

```{r view_array, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "array_1-setup"}

```

```{r view_array-solution}
# First -----
first_array
# Second -----
print(first_array)

```

```{r view_array-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Data Frames

Data Frames is an R object that can be thought of as R's version of a data set.

### 

::: info
#### What is a data set?

A data set is a method to store information about an experimental unit. The rows shows the characteristics (data) related each specific experimental unit, and the columns explains what the data characteristic.
:::

### 

#### Structure of a data frame

The structure of a data frame is similar to a data set, the rows represent a single observation, and the columns represent the variables. For example type `head(mtcars)` to view the first six observations of the `mtcars` data frame,

```{r mpg-head, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r mpg-head-solution}
head(mtcars)
```

```{r mpg-head-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Here each row represents a car and each column represents measurements of the car.

For this class, we will want to access variable is the data set. The general code to access a variable is by specifying the name of the data frame, typing the `$` symbol, and then the name of the variable. Generally speaking, to code goes as follow: `DATA$VARIABLE`. This tells R to look in the `DATA` data frame and get the `VARIABLE` variable. Now using the `mtcars` data set, print out the `mpg` variable:

```{r mpg-hwy, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r mpg-hwy-solution}
mtcars$mpg
```

```{r mpg-hwy-check}
grade_this_code()
```

If you want to know what variables are in a data frame, use the `names()`. What are the variables of `mtcars`?

```{r mtcars_names, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r mtcars_names-solution}
names(mtcars)
```

```{r mtcars_names-check}
grade_this_code()
```

::: {#mtcars_names-hint}
`mtcars` can be used as the input for the function.
:::

#### Creating a Data Frame

To create a data frame, we use the `data.frame()` function. This will allow you to specify the variables and the data for each variable. Let's create a new data frame called `new_df` which would have four observations and two variables. The first variable is called `x` which is a vector containing the first four letters of the alphabet, and `y` is a vector containing numbers one through four.

```{r new_df, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r new_df-solution}
new_df <- data.frame(x = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), 
                     y = c(1:4))
```

```{r new_df-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Try viewing the data frame:

```{r head_new_df, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r head_new_df-solution}
head(new_df)
```

```{r head_new_df-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Lists

To me a list is just a container that you can store practically anything. It is compiled of elements, where each element contains an R object. For example, the first element of a list may contain a data frame, the second element may contain a vector, and the third element may contain another list. It is just another way to store things.

To create a list, use the `list()` function. Create a list compiled of first element with the `mtcars` data set, second element with a vector of zeros of size 4, and a matrix $3 \times 3$ identity matrix. An identity matrix is a matrix where the diagonal elements are 1 and the non-diagonal elements are 0. Store the list in an object called `list_one`:

```{r list_C_One, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_C_One-solution}
list_one <- list(mtcars, 
                 rep(0, 4), 
                 diag(rep(1, 3)))
```

```{r list_C_One-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Type `list_one` to see what pops out:

```{r list_one, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_one-solution}
list_one
```

```{r list_one-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Each element in the list is labeled as a number. It is more useful to have the elements named. An element is named by typing the name in quotes followed by the `=` symbol before your object in the `list()` function (`mtcars = mtcars`). Create a new list and call it `list_two` by naming each element form `list_one`:

``` default
list(mtcars = mtcars, 
     vector = rep(0, 4),
     identity = diag(rep(1, 3)))
```

```{r list_two, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_two-solution}
list_two <- list(mtcars = mtcars, 
                 vector = rep(0, 4), 
                 identity = diag(rep(1, 3)))
```

```{r list_two-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Print out `list_two`

```{r list_two_print, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_two_print-solution}
list_two
```

```{r list_two_print-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Here I am creating an object called `list_two`, where the first element is `mtcars` labeled `mtcars`, the second element is a vector of zeros labeled `vector` and the last element is the identity matrix labeled `identity`.'

Let's say you want to access the data set `mtcars` from `list_two`. You can do this similar to accessing a variable from a data frame with a `$` sign: `LIST_NAME$ELEMENT_NAME`. Type `list_two$mtcars`:

```{r list_two_data, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_two_data-solution}
list_two$mtcars
```

```{r list_two_data-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now create a new list called `list_three` and store `list_two` labeled as `list_one` and `first_array` labeled as `array`.

```{r list_three, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_three-solution}
list_three <- list(list_two = list_two, 
                   array = first_array)
```

```{r list_three-check}
grade_this_code()
```

To view the list, type `list_three`:

```{r list_three_print, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r list_three_print-solution}
list_three
```

```{r list_three_print-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### `is.XXX()`

You can use the following functions to determine if an object is a vector, matrix, and other objects is the `is.xxx()` generic functions: `is.vector()`, `is.matrix()`, `is.data.frame()`, and `is.list()`.

## Indexing

Each are objected can be indexed to access a specific element in the object. To index and object, you will use the square brackets next to an object. Additionally, the square brackets `[]` can be thought of a special function arguments `(...)`, and can accept multiple arguments. It will become clearer as you progress in this section.

### Vector

A vector can be a certain data type with a set number of elements. Here we construct a vector called `x` increasing from -5 to 5 by one unit:

```{r vi_1, echo=TRUE}
x <- -5:5
```

```{r vi_1-setup}
(x <- -5:5)
```

The vector `x` has 11 elements. If we want access the 6th element of `x`, we will use `[]` square brackets after `x` to index it. For example, we index the 6th element of `x`:

```{r vi_2, echo=TRUE}
x[6]
```

Now, try indexing the the 8th element in the vector `x`:

```{r vi_3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "vi_1-setup"}

```

```{r vi_3-solution}
x[8]
```

```{r vi_3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now try the following code: `x[c(8)]`

```{r vi_4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="vi_1-setup"}

```

```{r vi_4-solution}
x[c(8)]
```

```{r vi_4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

```{r vi_q1, echo=FALSE}
question("What does the above code tell you?",
  answer("c(8) = 8", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The code ignores `c()`"),
  answer("The input in the bracket can be a vector.", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  correct = "Correct!! When using a vector to index an R object, it will extract the elements representing the values and output them as a vector."
)
```

Now write the code to extract the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 11th element from `x`:

```{r vi_5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="vi_1-setup"}

```

```{r vi_5-solution}
# First -----
x[c(2, 3, 4, 7, 11)]
# Second -----
x[c(2:4, 7, 11)]

```

```{r vi_5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Matrices

A matrix can be indexed the same way as a vector using the `[]` brackets. However, since the matrix is a 2-dimensional objects, we will need to include a comma to represent the different dimensions: `[, ]`. The first element indexes the row and the second element indexes the columns. To begin, we have created the following $4 \times 3$ matrix:

```{r mi-setup}
y <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
```

```{r mi_1}
y <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
```

Now to index the element at row 2 and column 3, use `y[2, 3]`:

```{r mi_2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="mi-setup"}

```

```{r mi_2-solution}
y[2, 3]
```

```{r mi_2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

What if we want to extract only the 4th row of `y`, how would you code it:

```{r mi_3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="mi-setup"}

```

```{r mi_3-solution}
y[4,]
```

```{r mi_3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

::: {#mi_3-hint}
You only need to put one number in the brackets and a comma.
:::

Now try to extract the 2nd column of `y`:

```{r mi_4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="mi-setup"}

```

```{r mi_4-solution}
y[, 2]
```

```{r mi_4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

::: {#mi_4-hint}
Similar to previous example, you only need one number, but switch the position.
:::

```{r mi_q1, echo=FALSE}
question("Looking at the previous 2 examples, what type of R object is it? Use the sandbox below to test what type of object is it.",
         answer("Vector", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Matrix"),
         answer("Data Frame"),
         answer("List"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
         )
```

```{r mi_q2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="mi-setup", exercise.cap = "Sandbox"}

```

If you want to keep the outputted object as a matrix, you will need to add `drop=FALSE` as a new argument in `[]`. Try extracting the 4th row of `y` while keeping it as a matrix:

```{r mi_5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="mi-setup"}

```

```{r mi_5-solution}
y[4, , drop=FALSE]
```

```{r mi_5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

::: {#mi_5-hint}
Add `drop=FALSE` as a new argument in `[]`. You will need to have 2 commas.
:::

Now try it for the 2nd column of `y` and keep it as a matrix:

```{r mi_6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="mi-setup"}

```

```{r mi_6-solution}
y[, 2, drop=FALSE]
```

```{r mi_6-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Data Frames

There are several ways to index a data frame, since it is in a tabular (matrix) format, you can index it the same way as a matrix. Here are a couple of examples using the `mtcars` data frame. Below we extract the 2nd column and 2nd row:

```{r dfi_1, echo=TRUE}
mtcars[,2]
mtcars[2,]
```

However, a data frame has labeled columns, variables, we can index the data frame with the variable names within the brackets:

```{r}
mtcars[, "cyl"]
```

Additionally, a data frame can be indexed to a specific variable using the `$`.

Now, subset the first 4 rows of `mtcars` and only display `cyl`, `disp`, and `hp`:

```{r dfi_2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r dfi_2-solution}
mtcars[1:4, c("cyl", "disp", "hp")]
```

```{r dfi_2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Lists

Lists contain elements holding different R objects. To index a specific element of a list, you will use `[[]]` double brackets. Below is a toy list:

```{r li_1, echo=TRUE}
toy_list <- list(mtcars = mtcars,
                 vector = rep(0, 4),
                 identity = diag(rep(1, 3)))
```

To access the second element, vector element, you can type `toy_list[[2]]`

```{r li_2, echo=TRUE}
toy_list[[2]]
```

Since the elements are labeled within the list, you can place the label in quotes inside `[[]]`:

```{r li_3, echo=TRUE}
toy_list[["vector"]]
```

The element can be accessed using the `$` notation with a list:

```{r li_4, echo=TRUE}
toy_list$vector
```

Lastly, you can further index the list if needed, we can access the `mpg` variable in `mtcars` from the `toy_list`:

```{r li_5, echo=TRUE}
toy_list$mtcars$mpg
toy_list[["mtcars"]]$mpg
toy_list$mtcars[,'mpg']
```

### 

::: warning
#### Other Programming Languages

In R, the first element of an R object is labeled as `1`. While in other programming languages, like python, the first element labeled as `0`.
:::

## Loading Data

There are three methods to load a data set in R: using base R, using tidyverse, or using RStudio. While it is important to understand how the code works to load a data set, I recommend using RStudio to import the data. It does all the work for you. Additionally, if you decide to use tidyverse packages, RStudio will provide corresponding code for a particular file.

To import a data set using RStudio, head over to the Environment tab (usually in the upper right hand pane) and click on the Import Dataset button. A pop-up window should look something like below.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/import.png")
```

Notice how there are several options to load a data set. Depending on the format, you may want to choose one of those options. Next, notice how there are 2 "From Text". This is because it will load text data using either Base R packages or the `readr::` package from tidyverse. Either works, but the `readr::` package provides the necessary code to load the data set in the window. The other one provides the code in the console.

### CSV Files

A CSV file is a type of text file that where the values are separated from commas. It is very common file that you will work with. Here I will provide the code necessary to import a CSV file using either Base R or `readr::` code.

#### Base R

``` default
read.csv("FILE_NAME_AND_LOCATION")
```

#### `readr::`

``` default
read_csv("FILE_NAME_AND_LOCATION")
```

Notice that the functions are virtually the same.

### 

::: info
#### Reading other data file types?

Both base R and `readr::` is great at reading tabular text files separated from some kind of delimiter. However, they struggle to read data of different formats. For example, if you have an excel file that needs to be read into R, you will need to use the [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package. If you need to read other files from other software packages, such as SAS or SPSS, use the [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) package. While there are some differences in the type of data files, the syntax is generally the same as the `readr::`.
